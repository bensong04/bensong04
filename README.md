hey, i'm ben and i'm currently a rising sophomore studying electrical/computer engineering at carnegie mellon, as well as hopefully a double major in mathematics. i'm broadly interested in writing highly optimized, fast software, especially as that relates to engineering efficient ways to train and evaluate machine learning models. i also like math a lot (with the exception of analysis).

beyond academics, i'm a pretty big fan of all things relating to music. i've been trying to start a vinyl collection, but haven't had much success, mainly due to my own procrastination.

this summer, i'll be working on [opencxl](https://opencxl.org/) as an intern at [eeum](eeum.io). opencxl is a python-based platform for emulating cxl devices.

please reach out to me via my [email](mailto:benedict04song@gmail.com) or discord (amnsc) if we share any interests, or if you'd just like to chat!
